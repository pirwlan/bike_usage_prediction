# Predicting bike sharing demand

This is my approach to a simple Regression problem presentend in a Kaggle competition. Here, the use case is the prediction of the number of rented bikes per hour. 

Using a rather simple and robust solution, based on a Polynominal regressor, I could reach the top 5 % in the competition.
